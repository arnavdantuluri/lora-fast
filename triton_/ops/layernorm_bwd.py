# Backward pass
# -------------
#
# The backward pass for the layer normalization operator is a bit more involved than the forward pass.
# Let :math:`\hat{x}` be the normalized inputs :math:`\frac{ x - \text{E}[x] }{ \sqrt{\text{Var}(x) + \epsilon} }` before the linear transformation,
# the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) :math:`\nabla_{x}` of :math:`x` are given by:
#
# .. math::
#    \nabla_{x} = \frac{1}{\sigma}\Big( \nabla_{y} \odot w - \underbrace{ \big( \frac{1}{N} \hat{x} \cdot (\nabla_{y} \odot w) \big) }_{c_1} \odot \hat{x} - \underbrace{ \frac{1}{N} \nabla_{y} \cdot w }_{c_2} \Big)
#
# where :math:`\odot` denotes the element-wise multiplication, :math:`\cdot` denotes the dot product, and :math:`\sigma` is the standard deviation.
# :math:`c_1` and :math:`c_2` are intermediate constants that improve the readability of the following implementation.
#
# For the weights :math:`w` and biases :math:`b`, the VJPs :math:`\nabla_{w}` and :math:`\nabla_{b}` are more straightforward:
#
# .. math::
#    \nabla_{w} = \nabla_{y} \odot \hat{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla_{b} = \nabla_{y}
#
# Since the same weights :math:`w` and biases :math:`b` are used for all rows in the same batch, their gradients need to sum up.
# To perform this step efficiently, we use a parallel reduction strategy: each kernel instance accumulates
# partial :math:`\nabla_{w}` and :math:`\nabla_{b}` across certain rows into one of :math:`\text{GROUP_SIZE_M}` independent buffers.
# These buffers stay in the L2 cache and then are further reduced by another function to compute the actual :math:`\nabla_{w}` and :math:`\nabla_{b}`.
#
# Let the number of input rows :math:`M = 4` and :math:`\text{GROUP_SIZE_M} = 2`,
# here's a diagram of the parallel reduction strategy for :math:`\nabla_{w}` (:math:`\nabla_{b}` is omitted for brevity):
#
#   .. image:: parallel_reduction.png
#
# In Stage 1, the rows of X that have the same color share the same buffer and thus a lock is used to ensure that only one kernel instance writes to the buffer at a time.
# In Stage 2, the buffers are further reduced to compute the final :math:`\nabla_{w}` and :math:`\nabla_{b}`.
# In the following implementation, Stage 1 is implemented by the function :code:`_layer_norm_bwd_dx_fused` and Stage 2 is implemented by the function :code:`_layer_norm_bwd_dwdb`.
